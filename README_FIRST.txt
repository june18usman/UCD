This code was developed for the results presented in the research paper "Comparison of Machine Learning and Validation Methods for High-Dimensional Accelerometer Data to Detect Foot Lesions in Dairy Cattle." These codes and data files can be used to reproduce all the presented results in the paper.

The data files (.csv and .xlsx) are described as follows:

AllCowsDataX: Contains raw accelerometer data for 383 cows in the Z direction, without dimensionality reduction (20,000 features).
AfterPCA_AllCowsX: Contains the principal components of the accelerometer data for 383 cows in the Z direction, representing the reduced dataset after PCA.
AfterFPCA_AllCowsX: Contains the functional principal components of the accelerometer data for 383 cows in the Z direction, representing the reduced dataset after FPCA.

CombConorAll: Contains the binary lameness classification outcome (0/1) based on clinical assessments of each cow.
